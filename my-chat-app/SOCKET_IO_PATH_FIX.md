# WebSocket Connection Implementation

## Issue

The frontend was attempting to use Socket.IO connections, but the user's backend WebSocket server at `wss://${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/ws/ws` is working correctly.

## Solution

Replaced all Socket.IO implementations with direct WebSocket connections using the working backend URL.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Working Backend**: The user's backend WebSocket server at `wss://${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/ws/ws` is functioning correctly
2. **Frontend Mismatch**: The frontend was attempting to use Socket.IO connections instead of direct WebSocket
3. **Configuration Error**: Various incorrect Socket.IO configurations were tried, causing connection failures

## Files Updated

### 1. src/pages/chat/Chat.jsx

- Replaced Socket.IO with direct WebSocket connection to `wss://${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/ws/ws`
- Implemented proper WebSocket event handlers (onopen, onmessage, onclose, onerror)
- Added message type routing for different functionalities

### 2. src/components/GlobalCallNotification.jsx

- Replaced Socket.IO with direct WebSocket connection to `wss://${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/ws/ws`
- Implemented WebSocket event handlers for call notifications

### 3. src/components/UserStatus/UserStatus.jsx

- Replaced Socket.IO with direct WebSocket connection to `wss://${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/ws/ws`
- Implemented WebSocket event handlers for user status tracking

## Why This Implementation Works

### Direct WebSocket Connection

Using direct WebSocket connections provides several advantages:

1. **Compatibility**: Direct match with the working backend configuration
2. **Performance**: Lower latency and reduced overhead
3. **Simplicity**: Fewer abstraction layers and simpler debugging
4. **Reliability**: Proven working connection method

### Message Type Routing

All WebSocket messages use a consistent format with type routing:

```javascript
{
  type: "message-type",
  data: { /* message data */ }
}
```

This allows for proper handling of different message types:

- `get-users`: Online user list updates
- `user-status-update`: User presence information
- `receive-message`: Chat messages
- `agora-signal`: Video call signaling

## Verification Steps

1. **Connection Success**

   - Check browser console for successful connection messages:
     - "ðŸ”— Connecting to WebSocket: wss://[your-domain]/ws/ws"
     - "âœ… WebSocket connected successfully"

2. **Functionality Testing**

   - Test chat messaging between users
   - Verify online/offline status updates
   - Test incoming call notifications on all routes

3. **Error Resolution**
   - Confirm that all connection errors are resolved
   - Ensure proper error handling for network interruptions

## Technical Details

### WebSocket Connection Lifecycle

1. **Connection Establishment**: Connect to `wss://${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/ws/ws`
2. **User Registration**: Send `new-user-add` message to register user
3. **Message Handling**: Process incoming messages based on type
4. **Periodic Updates**: Send user status updates every 30 seconds
5. **Cleanup**: Send offline status and close connection on unmount

### Event Handler Implementation

Each component implements proper WebSocket event handlers:

- `onopen`: Connection established
- `onmessage`: Message received and processed
- `onclose`: Connection closed
- `onerror`: Connection error handling

### Connection Management

Proper connection management includes:

- Periodic status updates to maintain presence
- Window focus/blur event handling for away status
- Graceful cleanup on component unmount
- Error recovery and reconnection logic
