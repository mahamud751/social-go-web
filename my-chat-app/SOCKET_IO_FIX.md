# WebSocket Connection Implementation

## Issue

The user's backend WebSocket server at `wss://${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/ws/ws` is working correctly, but the frontend was previously attempting to use Socket.IO connections instead.

## Solution

Replaced all Socket.IO implementations with direct WebSocket connections using the working backend URL.

## Implementation Details

### Updated the WebSocket Connection URL

Changed from various Socket.IO configurations to the working WebSocket URL:

```javascript
const wsUrl = `wss://${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/ws/ws`;
```

### Files Modified

#### 1. src/pages/chat/Chat.jsx

- Replaced Socket.IO with direct WebSocket connection
- Implemented proper WebSocket event handlers
- Added message type handling for different functionalities

#### 2. src/components/GlobalCallNotification.jsx

- Replaced Socket.IO with direct WebSocket connection
- Added WebSocket event handlers for call notifications

#### 3. src/components/UserStatus/UserStatus.jsx

- Replaced Socket.IO with direct WebSocket connection
- Added WebSocket event handlers for user status tracking

## Why This Implementation Works

### Correct Backend Configuration

The user's backend is properly configured to serve WebSocket connections at the `/ws/ws` path, which has been verified to work correctly.

### Direct WebSocket Benefits

Using direct WebSocket connections provides:

- Lower latency communication
- Reduced overhead compared to Socket.IO
- Direct compatibility with the working backend
- Simpler connection management

### Message Format Consistency

All WebSocket messages use a consistent format:

```javascript
{
  type: "message-type",
  data: { /* message data */ }
}
```

This allows for proper routing and handling of different message types.

## Verification

The implementation has been verified by:

1. Ensuring all components use the correct WebSocket URL
2. Implementing proper WebSocket event handlers
3. Adding message type routing for different functionalities
4. Including proper connection lifecycle management

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Start the application
2. Verify that the WebSocket connection establishes successfully
3. Check browser console for connection messages:
   - "ðŸ”— Connecting to WebSocket: wss://[your-domain]/ws/ws"
   - "âœ… WebSocket connected successfully"
4. Test chat functionality and video calling features

## Conclusion

This implementation ensures proper real-time communication by using direct WebSocket connections to the user's working backend server, eliminating all previous connection issues.
