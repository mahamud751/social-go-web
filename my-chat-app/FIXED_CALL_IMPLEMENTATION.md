- ✅ Enhanced declineCall function with validation
- ✅ Added media permission checks before answering
- ✅ Improved call state transitions (idle → connecting → in-progress)
- ✅ Added proper cleanup on call rejection

### 4. **Agora Client Setup**

- ✅ Fixed client initialization with host role
- ✅ Enhanced token generation with proper validation
- ✅ Improved joinAgoraChannel with retry logic
- ✅ Added connection state monitoring
- ✅ Fixed track creation and publishing

### 5. **Call Ringing & Visual Effects**

- ✅ Added call duration tracking and display
- ✅ Implemented ringing sound effects
- ✅ Added visual ringing animations (pulse, shake, glow)
- ✅ Enhanced call status indicators
- ✅ Added call duration timer in MM:SS format

## 🔧 Environment Setup Required

Make sure you have these environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
REACT_APP_AGORA_APP_ID=your_agora_app_id_here
REACT_APP_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=your_agora_app_certificate_here
REACT_APP_API_URL=your_websocket_server_url_here
```

## 🧪 Testing the Fixed Implementation

### Test Case 1: Audio Call Flow

1. **User A** initiates audio call
2. **User B** receives incoming call notification with ringing
3. **User B** can accept or decline
4. If accepted, both users join Agora channel for audio
5. Call duration is tracked and displayed
6. Either user can end the call

### Test Case 2: Video Call Flow

1. **User A** initiates video call
2. **User B** receives incoming call notification
3. **User B** accepts call after permission check
4. Both users see local and remote video streams
5. Users can toggle mute/video during call
6. Call can be ended by either party

### Test Case 3: Call Rejection

1. **User A** calls **User B**
2. **User B** declines the call
3. **User A** receives "Call was declined" notification
4. Call state resets to idle for both users

### Test Case 4: Call Timeout

1. **User A** calls **User B**
2. **User B** doesn't answer within 60 seconds
3. Call automatically times out
4. Both users receive timeout notifications

## 🔍 Debug Console Messages

When testing, look for these console messages:

### Successful Call Flow:

```
🔄 Starting call with type: video
🔍 Checking media permissions...
🔑 Fetching Agora token for initiator...
✅ Agora token fetched successfully
🔗 Joining Agora channel...
✅ Joined channel successfully
📤 Sending call-request signal to: user123
✅ Call request sent successfully
```

### Incoming Call Reception:

```
📡 Received agora-signal: {action: "call-request", ...}
👤 Current user ID: user456
🎯 Target ID: user456
📊 Enhanced Signal routing analysis: {...}
✅ Processing agora-signal for current user: call-request
📞 Processing callData: {...}
📲 Processing incoming call request from: user123
✅ Setting up incoming call state
```

### Call Answer/Reject:

```
📞 Attempting to answer call {...}
🔍 Checking media permissions...
🔑 Fetching Agora token for answerer...
🔗 Joining Agora channel: chat_123_1234567890
✅ Successfully joined Agora channel
📤 Sending call-accepted signal: {...}
✅ Call acceptance signal sent successfully
✅ Call answered successfully
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "No answer from user"

**Cause:** Signal not reaching the target user
**Solution:** Check WebSocket connection and user IDs

### Issue 2: "Permission denied"

**Cause:** Camera/microphone access blocked
**Solution:** Allow permissions in browser settings

### Issue 3: "Network connection failed"

**Cause:** Poor internet or firewall issues
**Solution:** Check network and try again

### Issue 4: "Authentication failed"

**Cause:** Invalid Agora token or expired certificate
**Solution:** Verify environment variables
