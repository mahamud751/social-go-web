## ✨ Features Implemented

### 🌍 Global Coverage

- ✅ Works on **ALL routes** (home, profile, friends, etc.)
- ✅ Smart routing: Defers to ChatBox on `/chat` page
- ✅ No conflicts or duplicate modals
- ✅ Persistent across navigation

### 📞 Full Call Functionality

- ✅ **Accept calls**: Checks permissions → Generates token → Joins channel → Starts call
- ✅ **Decline calls**: Sends rejection → Stops ringing → Cleans up
- ✅ **Auto-decline**: 60-second timeout for unanswered calls
- ✅ **Caller info**: Fetches and displays caller profile data

### 🎨 Beautiful UI

- ✅ Material-UI components
- ✅ Dark/Light theme support
- ✅ Smooth animations (pulse, bounce, fade, slide)
- ✅ Ringing sound with volume control
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile + desktop)

### 🔧 Technical Excellence

- ✅ WebSocket integration via WebSocketService
- ✅ Agora RTC SDK for media handling
- ✅ Client-side token generation
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Resource cleanup on unmount
- ✅ React hooks best practices

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. The component is already integrated!

Just start your app:

```bash
cd my-chat-app
npm start
```

### 2. Test it

- Navigate to any page (e.g., `/home`, `/profile`)
- Have another user call you
- ✅ Modal should appear with caller info
- Click "Accept" or "Decline"

### 3. That's it! 🎉

---

## 📋 Quick Reference

### Accept Call Flow

```
Modal appears → Click "Accept" → Permissions check → Token generated
→ Agora joined → Navigate to /video-call → Call starts
```

### Decline Call Flow

```
Modal appears → Click "Decline" → Rejection sent → Sound stops
→ Modal closes → Resources cleaned up
```

### Route Behavior

```
/home, /profile, /friend, etc. → GlobalIncomingCallHandler handles
/chat                          → ChatBox handles (no conflict)
```

---

## 🎯 Key Code Snippets

### Accept Call

```javascript
// In GlobalIncomingCallHandler.jsx
const handleAcceptCall = async () => {
  // 1. Check permissions
  const hasPermissions = await checkMediaPermissions();

  // 2. Generate token
  const tokenData = await generateAgoraToken(channel, userId);

  // 3. Send acceptance signal
  WebSocketService.sendMessage({
    type: "agora-signal",
    data: { action: "call-accepted", ... }
  });

  // 4. Join Agora channel
  await joinAgoraChannel(channel, token, userId, callType);

  // 5. Navigate to call page
  navigate("/video-call", { state: { callData } });
};
```

### Route Detection

```javascript
// Defers to ChatBox on /chat page
const isOnChatPage = location.pathname === "/chat";
if (isOnChatPage) {
  return; // Let ChatBox handle it
}
```

## 🎨 Component Highlights

### State Management

```javascript
const [incomingCall, setIncomingCall] = useState(null);
const [isRinging, setIsRinging] = useState(false);
const [callerData, setCallerData] = useState(null);
const [isDarkTheme, setIsDarkTheme] = useState(false);
```

### WebSocket Integration

```javascript
WebSocketService.addMessageHandler((message) => {
  if (
    message.type === "agora-signal" &&
    message.data?.action === "call-request"
  ) {
    handleIncomingCall(message);
  }
});
```

### Agora Integration

```javascript
// Generate token client-side
const tokenData = await generateAgoraToken(channel, userId);

// Join channel
await joinAgoraChannel(channel, token, userId, callType);
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Modal not appearing?

1. Check WebSocket connection in browser console
2. Verify user is logged in
3. Make sure you're NOT on `/chat` page
4. Check for console errors

### Cannot accept call?

1. Allow camera/microphone permissions in browser
2. Verify Agora environment variables are set
3. Check internet connection
4. Look for errors in console

### No sound?

1. Browser may block autoplay - this is normal
2. Check system volume and browser tab mute
3. User must interact with page first (browser policy)
