# WebSocket Connection Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement

The user reported that their backend WebSocket server at `wss://${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/ws/ws` is working correctly, but they needed the frontend code to be implemented to work with that WebSocket server.

## Solution Implemented

Reverted all Socket.IO implementations and replaced them with direct WebSocket connections using the working backend URL.

### Files Updated:

1. **src/pages/chat/Chat.jsx**

   - Replaced Socket.IO with direct WebSocket connection
   - Updated URL to `wss://${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/ws/ws`
   - Implemented proper WebSocket event handlers (onopen, onmessage, onclose, onerror)
   - Added message type handling for different event types

2. **src/components/GlobalCallNotification.jsx**

   - Replaced Socket.IO with direct WebSocket connection
   - Updated URL to `wss://${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/ws/ws`
   - Implemented WebSocket event handlers
   - Added message filtering for agora-signal events

3. **src/components/UserStatus/UserStatus.jsx**
   - Replaced Socket.IO with direct WebSocket connection
   - Updated URL to `wss://${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/ws/ws`
   - Implemented WebSocket event handlers
   - Added user status update handling

## Technical Explanation

### WebSocket vs Socket.IO Architecture

The user's backend is configured to serve WebSocket connections at the `/ws/ws` path, which is working correctly. Rather than trying to connect to a separate Socket.IO server, we've implemented direct WebSocket connections that match the backend configuration.

### Message Format

All WebSocket messages use a consistent format:

```javascript
{
  type: "message-type",
  data: { /* message data */ }
}
```

This allows for proper routing and handling of different message types on both client and server sides.

### Connection Lifecycle

1. **Connection**: Establish WebSocket connection to `wss://${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/ws/ws`
2. **Initialization**: Send `new-user-add` message to register user
3. **Communication**: Handle various message types through onmessage handler
4. **Status Updates**: Periodically send user status updates
5. **Cleanup**: Send offline status and close connection on component unmount

## Verification Steps

1. **Connection Success**

   - Browser console should show:
     - "ðŸ”— Connecting to WebSocket: wss://[your-domain]/ws/ws"
     - "âœ… WebSocket connected successfully"

2. **Functionality Testing**
   - Real-time chat messaging between users
   - Online/offline status updates
   - Incoming call notifications on all routes
   - Video call functionality

## Implementation Details

### Chat Component WebSocket Implementation

The Chat component now uses direct WebSocket connections with:

- Proper event handlers for open, message, close, and error events
- Message type routing for different functionality (user status, chat messages, agora signals)
- Periodic status updates to maintain online presence
- Window focus/blur event handling for away status
- Proper cleanup on component unmount

### Global Call Notification WebSocket Implementation

The GlobalCallNotification component uses a separate WebSocket connection for:

- Receiving agora-signal events for incoming calls
- Playing ringing sound and showing notification modal
- Sending call rejection signals when calls are declined

### User Status WebSocket Implementation

The UserStatus component uses a WebSocket connection for:

- Tracking user online/offline status
- Receiving status updates for other users
- Broadcasting user status changes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Connection Testing**

   - Verify WebSocket connections establish successfully
   - Test automatic reconnection after network interruptions

2. **Call Functionality**

   - Test incoming call notifications on all routes
   - Verify video call routing and functionality

3. **User Status**

   - Verify accurate status updates
   - Test status persistence across navigation

4. **Error Handling**
   - Test device permission scenarios
   - Verify graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Conclusion

The WebSocket connection implementation has been successfully completed using the user's working backend WebSocket server at `wss://${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/ws/ws`. All frontend components have been updated to use direct WebSocket connections with proper message handling and lifecycle management.

This implementation:

- Matches the working backend configuration
- Provides all the required real-time functionality
- Includes proper error handling and connection management
- Maintains user status and presence information
- Supports the global call notification system
- Enables video calling through Agora integration
